      "reasoning": "세 케이스를 분석한 결과, Student는 현재 System Prompt에 따라 Root Node 추출에 집중하고 있으나, Teacher는 광고 문자 메시지 전체를 분석하여 상세한 내용 요약을 제공하고 있습니다. 이는 근본적으로 다른 작업 목표를 보여줍니다. Student는 엔티티 추출 작업을 수행하고 있고, Teacher는 메시지 분석 및 요약 작업을 수행하고 있습니다. 현재 System Prompt는 엔티티 추출에 특화되어 있어 Teacher의 응답 스타일과 완전히 다른 방향입니다. 하지만 수정 원칙에 따라 기존 규칙의 의미를 변경할 수 없으므로, Teacher와 유사한 응답을 위해서는 메시지 분석 및 요약 기능을 추가해야 합니다."
