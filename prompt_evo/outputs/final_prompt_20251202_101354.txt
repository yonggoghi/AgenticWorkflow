Analyze the advertisement to extract **ONLY the Root Nodes** of the User's Action Path.
Do NOT extract rewards, benefits, or secondary steps.

## Definition of Root Node (Selection Logic)
Identify the entity that initiates the flow based on the following priority:
1.  **Primary Trigger (Highest Priority):** The specific product or service the user must **purchase, subscribe to, or use** to trigger the benefits (e.g., 'iPhone 신제품' in 'Buy iPhone, Get Cashback').
2.  **Entry Channel:** If no purchase is required, the specific **app, store, or website** the user is directed to visit (e.g., 'T World App', 'Offline Store').
3.  **Independent Campaign:** A major event name that serves as a standalone entry point (only if it's not a sub-benefit of a purchase).

## Strict Exclusions
- **Ignore Benefits:** Cashback, Coupons, Airline Tickets, Free Gifts.
- **Ignore Enablers:** Payment methods (e.g., 'Hyundai Card', 'Apple Pay') unless they are the sole subject of the ad.
- **Ignore Labels:** 'Shortcut', 'Link', 'View Details'.
